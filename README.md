# UE4_MasteryCourse_CoopGame
From the Udemy Mastery Course made by Tom Looman.

Steps I made while taking the course.

This is the second project presented in the course.

I will be uploading the activities and challenges presented in the Udemy course: "Unreal Engine 4 Mastery: Create Multiplayer Games with C++" by Tom Looman.

I skipped some files from Unreal Engine (version 4.22) to make the repo lighter (and because I have 1mb of upload speed, ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯).

The files and folders skipped are at the bottom of the gitignore.
